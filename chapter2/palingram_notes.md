# Explaining the Palingrams Algorithm

A palingram is a pair of words that form a palindrome when concatenated. For example, "desserts" and "stressed" form "dessertsstressed", which reads the same forwards and backwards. Let me break down how this algorithm finds such word pairs.

## What the Algorithm Does

This code systematically finds all possible word pairs in a dictionary where concatenating them creates a palindrome. Here's how it works step by step:

1. It loads a dictionary of words into `word_list`.
2. For each word in the dictionary, it creates a reversed version (`rev_word`).
3. It then tries all possible ways to split the current word and checks if either:
   - The suffix of the current word can be paired with another dictionary word to form a palindrome
   - The prefix of the current word can be paired with another dictionary word to form a palindrome

## The Core Logic Explained

The heart of the algorithm is in these two conditions inside the nested loops:

```python
if word[i:] == rev_word[:end-i] and rev_word[end-i:] in word_list:
    pali_list.append((word, rev_word[end-i:]))
if word[:i] == rev_word[end-i:] and rev_word[:end-i] in word_list:
    pali_list.append((rev_word[:end-i], word))
```

Let's understand what these are checking:

### First Condition: Checking Suffixes

```python
if word[i:] == rev_word[:end-i] and rev_word[end-i:] in word_list:
```

This checks if we can find a palindrome by taking:
- The **suffix** of the current word (everything from position `i` to the end)
- Paired with another word from the dictionary

For example, with word "nurses" (length 6):
- For `i = 3`, we check if suffix "ses" is equal to the first 3 characters of reversed "nurses" (which is "sesrun")
- "ses" equals "ses", so we check if "run" (the rest of "sesrun") is in the dictionary
- If "run" is in the dictionary, we add ("nurses", "run") to our palingrams list

### Second Condition: Checking Prefixes

```python
if word[:i] == rev_word[end-i:] and rev_word[:end-i] in word_list:
```

This checks if we can find a palindrome by taking:
- The **prefix** of the current word (everything from the beginning to position `i`)
- Paired with another word from the dictionary

For example, with word "drawer" (length 6):
- For `i = 4`, we check if prefix "draw" is equal to the last 4 characters of reversed "drawer" (which is "reward")
- "draw" equals "ward", so we check if "re" (the rest of "reward") is in the dictionary
- If "re" is in the dictionary, we add ("re", "drawer") to our palingrams list

## A Concrete Example

Let's trace through the algorithm with a simple example word: "tac" (cat backwards):

1. `word = "tac"`, `end = 3`, `rev_word = "cat"`
2. For `i = 0`:
   - First condition: "tac" != "cat", so no match
   - Second condition: "" != "cat", so no match
3. For `i = 1`:
   - First condition: "ac" != "ca", so no match
   - Second condition: "t" != "t", so no match
4. For `i = 2`:
   - First condition: "c" == "c" ✓, and "at" is in dictionary ✓
   - Add ("tac", "at") to palingrams
   - Second condition: "ta" != "at", so no match
5. For `i = 3`:
   - First condition: "" == "" ✓, and "cat" is in dictionary ✓
   - Add ("tac", "cat") to palingrams
   - Second condition: "tac" != "", so no match

So this algorithm would find the palingrams ("tac", "at") and ("tac", "cat"), which form "tacat" and "taccat" respectively - both are palindromes!

## Why This Approach Works

The algorithm systematically checks all possible ways to split each word and looks for matching words that would create palindromes when concatenated. It's a complete search that ensures no possible palingram pairs are missed.

The time complexity is O(n·m²) where n is the number of words and m is the average word length, making it feasible even for large dictionaries.
